	<p>This OPEN MINDS assessment is focused on the organizational and technical competencies service provider organizations need to make a successful transition to value-based reimbursement. Our tool was designed to evaluate and identify recommendations in 6 key management domains at each level of the value-based system. The tool is an organizational assessment, and you may only take one assessment at a time. After submitting a completed assessment, you can view archived results or start a new assessment the next time you access the tool. Simultaneous users of this assessment is not recommended as answers may not be recorded properly for accurate findings and recommendations.
